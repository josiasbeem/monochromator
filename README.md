# Monochromator

A simple **monochrome** theme for **Visual Studio Code**.

If you also get a **headache** from the **color fiasco** of mainstream color schemes, then this extension is **just for you**. Too many **colors distract** you from **thinking clearly**.

That's why this theme uses only **black**, **white**, **gray** and the color **blue** (which highlights URLs, literals, etc.). The only exception to this rule are the colors for the Git decorations and errors / warnings, which also use red, orange and green. Additionally, if you are working under GNOME, this theme will fit very well into the overall desktop environment.

Following **two variants** are included:

### Monochromator Dark
